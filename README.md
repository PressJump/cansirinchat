## Unpack Extension Somewhere
Unpack the extension into some folder from the .zip found in releases.

## Setup on Chrome
First go to the hamburger menu on top right. From here go to more tools then extensions. Enable developer mode on top right and press the button upload unpacked then select the folder where the extension was unpacked.

## Setup on Firefox
Go to your Firefox Settings, Extensions & Themes and press Extensions. Then from the settings icon press debug add-ons and Load Temporary Addon. This will go away when you restart Firefox but I will let you know when it is signed.
